## Contact

We would rather not to be disturbed, but you can still reach some of us 
in [SCP-079-CHAT](https://t.me/SCP_079_CHAT) group.

You can also send an email to `admin@scp-079.org` if you intend to cooperate.

## Appeal

We monthly clear all user related data, including blacklist contents(see [Data Minimize Principle](/principles/Data Minimize Principle)). You shall appeal a certain case only if you have been banned and are still in the blacklist. Be aware that we would never give excuse to those who pradically spammed.

- If you believe you were blocked by mistake, send  command /status to [SCP_079_TICKET_BOT](https://t.me/SCP_079_TICKET_BOT) and check your status. If you have been unfortunately marked as a spammer, you'd better leave a message there and wait for responses from SCP-079 Workgroup. We recommend this since once we lift the error in a short time, multiple groups would unblock you.
- However if we closed your ticket for evidence excess our criterion, there is still another way out for you. Try to contact and explain to administrators in certain groups and let them decide whether to unblock. SCP_079_TICKET_BOT will show you the command which administrations can use to set a single exception. See below:
