# Object Classes

All projects and channels are assigned an Object Class. An Object Class is a part of the standard Project template and serves as a rough indicator for the extent to which these objects can be dangerous. In universe, Object Classes are for the purposes of identifying actual needs, development priority, security risks, and other considerations. A Project's Object Class is determined by a number of factors, but the most important factors are the threats to privacy and freedom of expression.
