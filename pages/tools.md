At present, for anti-spam bot, there is only the old bot, which, however, is a 
closed source user-bot. The new open source project is under development. It is 
expected to take a year to complete. The more participants, the less 
time it takes to complete other bots.

So we can't guarantee a reliable timeline for the initial completion of 
the project, before that, you can still use the old bot according to 
your needs. However, the old bot is extremely buggy, please use it 
with caution.
